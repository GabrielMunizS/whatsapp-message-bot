# whatsapp-message-bot
It is a bot that uses selenium(primely) to send a bunch of messages in whatsapp (read the README)


# BE CAREFUL
Whatsapp have an official API and if you use this bot to send messages by yourself you can get banned or worse.
I won't take any responsibility if something happens to you.

# How to Use
1° Download the webdriver (I used chrome webdriver 'cause I think that's what works the best for me, but you can use another one, adjust the code as you wish);  
2° You will need a file that looks like the one I attached, then you just need to fill it as you please;  
3° You will need to login in your whatsapp web using the qr code;  
4° Again, be careful.
